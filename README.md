Chokidar wrapper named after a joke by @thealphanerd

## Acknowledgements

The project [`chokidar-child`](https://github.com/mcollina/chokidar-child) supports
the most basic functionality of watching in a child process and notifying the main
process, but I wanted some more intelligence behind the API because many people start
multiple watchers in gulp.
